# Working group meeting 20200715

## Requirements work update

- Philipp has been thinking about what the requirements management flow might look like.
- We need a tool that can grab issue and pull/merge request information from GitHub and GitLab, such as descriptions and comments
  - How much history is needed? Do we need to keep every version of edited comments for auditing purposes? Does this history need to extend to after the requirement was accepted and merged?
  - The `grge` tool has features that may be copyable into current `trice`. This is an option, but `grge` has some features we don't need like syncing to a database.
  - The old `trice` is also an option, but it's now a legacy tool so cleanup and ongoing maintenance would be necessary.
- Several options have been considered for synchronising Doorstop requirements with GitLab labels.
  - The `python-gitlab` library was rejected as being overengineered.
  - `marge-bot` has a better API but is synchronous.
  - `grge` is expected to have the ability to do GitLab API queries within weeks, so perhaps adding an understanding of the Doorstop API could be useful.
  - Just using the existing GitLab API could get us going quickly.

## Watchdog nodes

- Mapless has produced a ROS 2 watchdog timer library.
- https://gitlab.com/MaplessAI/external/sw_watchdog
- It uses component nodes that can be composed with the node(s) you want to set a watchdog on, enabling you to detect when the containing process dies.
- We want to move this under the working group's umbrella.


##  Action items

- Geoff will begin putting together a proposal for changes to REP 2004 to identify what we need to make possible before we can make it required by REP 2004.
  - https://github.com/ros2/safety_working_group/issues/12
- Geoff to ask Apex.AI if they have any learnings and best practices about design documentation that they can make open for the ROS community to learn from.
  - https://github.com/ros2/safety_working_group/issues/13
- Geoff will set up a task board for the working group to coordinate work through
  - https://github.com/ros2/safety_working_group/issues/17
- Geoff will investigate where we can store software projects the working group "owns".
  - https://github.com/ros2/safety_working_group/issues/16
- Geoff will look into setting up the working group governance document based on [the template]().
  - https://github.com/ros2/safety_working_group/issues/18
- Philipp and Florian to follow up on whether we can use `grge` for getting issue and P/MR history
