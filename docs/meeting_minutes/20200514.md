## Doorstop open-source tool for requirements management

- https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop
- An open-source tool that stores requirements in a Git repository
- Requirements are stored as YAML-formatted text files
- It can generate simple reports on the tracing of requirements
- The front-end leaves something to be desired but it looks good as a back-end

## Sample requirements repository

- Repository created [here](https://gitlab.com/MaplessAI/external/requirements-testing)
- [See here](https://github.com/ros2/safety_working_group/issues/10#issuecomment-623128663) for
  discussion


## Requirements management process

- This would probably follow something similar to a code review process, with reviews of PRs that
  alter requirements for whatever the requirement acceptance criteria are (compliance with relevant
  standards, consistency, etc.)
- We could write a script/bot that captures the review discussion and dumps it into a file as part
  of the requirement history.
- A wiki is an option but it has significant drawbacks, such as not being able to easily display
  version history of the wiki content, lack of protected branches, etc.
