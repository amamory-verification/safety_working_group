- CI has been added to the contracts repository and the watchdogs repository.

## Requirements work progress review

- A follow-up meeting was held with Tenaris. They gave us a walkthrough of trice's code and capabilities.
- Trice can currently:
  - Pull issues and MRs from GitLab (non-recursive, i.e. just the one you refer to will be pulled)
    - The information is pulled into a markdown file.
    - It pulls title, author, ...
    - What to pull is specified in a template called Ginger2
  - Pull issue labels that you specify on the command line (each issue label must be associated with a requirement)
- Trice doesn't currently support GitHub, but we have moved the requirements playground to GitHub. So to test Trice the old repository is still being used.
- A test/example script has been written to sync labels to GitLab using Trice
  - https://github.com/ros-safety/requirements-playground/blob/master/scripts/trice_sync.py
- Issues have been created at the Trice repository to start hashing out how we want to use the tool and what our workflow will ideally be
  - https://gitlab.com/ternaris/trice/-/issues/1
  - https://gitlab.com/ternaris/trice/-/issues/2
  - https://gitlab.com/ternaris/trice/-/issues/3 (this one discusses the proposed workflow)
  - https://gitlab.com/ternaris/trice/-/issues/4
- The tools and workflow are starting to be tested on the ray-ground classifier from Autoware.Auto, which is a self-contained function with well-defined inputs and outputs.
