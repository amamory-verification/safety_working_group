## Working group repository and website revision

The ROS 2 TSC has approved a new governance document template for working groups.
This template has been applied to the Safety-Critical Systems Working Group, including re-organising the repository.

We will briefly review the content of the governance document to ensure all participants are familiar with it.
We will also discuss any changes we wish to make for our specific working group.
