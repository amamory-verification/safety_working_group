# Working group meeting 20200130

## Attendees

- Geoffrey Biggs (Tier IV)
- Shawn Schaerer (Northstar Robotics)
- Matt Droter

## Notes

- An additional activity could be listing the pitfalls of using ROS in a safety-critical system,
  for new companies in particular who don't know why they should choose ROS over just a certified
  DDS.
- It could be good to also include information on what to do as well as what not to do.
- This sort of activity needs to be treated with time and patience, and be built up over time as we
  think of or experience things to consider.


## Action items

- Set up a section on the website for the ROS Safety Critical Cookbook - @gbiggs
